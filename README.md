Introduction
Plant diseases can have a significant impact on crop yield and quality. Detecting and diagnosing these diseases early can help farmers take timely action and prevent potential losses. This project aims to automate the process of disease detection using machine learning algorithms. By training a model on a labeled dataset of plant disease images, we can create a system that can identify diseases accurately and efficiently.

Dataset
The success of any machine learning project depends on the quality and size of the dataset. In this project, we utilize a publicly available dataset of plant disease images. The dataset contains a diverse range of images of healthy plants and various diseased plants affected by different diseases. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease type or marked as healthy.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd plant-disease-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (for Linux/Mac), venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows PowerShell)
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the plant disease detection system, follow these steps:

Ensure that the required packages and dependencies are installed (see the Installation section).
Prepare your input images of plants or plant leaves to be analyzed.
Run the inference script with the path to the input image(s): python infer.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
The system will process the image and provide the predicted disease class or indicate if the plant is healthy.
Repeat the process for each input image that needs to be analyzed.
Model Training
Training a plant disease detection model involves the following steps:

Acquire or collect a dataset of plant disease images, ensuring that each image is labeled with the corresponding disease class or healthy label.
Preprocess the images, which may include resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.
Split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance during training.
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm or deep learning architecture for the task, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Train the model using the labeled dataset, adjusting hyperparameters and employing techniques like transfer learning if necessary.
Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set and iterate on the model architecture or training process to improve results.
Save the trained model weights and necessary metadata for later use during inference.
Inference
Inference refers to the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. To perform inference using the trained plant disease detection model:

Ensure that the required packages and dependencies are installed (see the Installation section).
Run the inference script with the path to the input image(s): python infer.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
The system will load the trained model and preprocess the input image.
The model will then make predictions on the image and display the predicted disease class or indicate if the plant is healthy.
Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the plant disease detection model, various metrics can be used. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's ability to correctly classify healthy plants and identify different diseases accurately. Additionally, visual inspection and analysis of false positives and false negatives can provide insights into potential areas of improvement.

Results
Include any relevant results and findings obtained from the project. This may include accuracy achieved on the test set, visualizations of predictions, comparisons between different models or techniques, and any other relevant insights.
